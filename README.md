# Fall 2024 Learning Goals - W. Brooks Arthur

## Learning Goal 1: Develop Proficiency in Full-Stack Web Development with Advanced Tools

### Learning Objective: 
Gain expertise in both frontend and backend web development using advanced tools and frameworks such as Flask, Jest, Next.js, Tailwind, Ant Design, GraphQL, and Keystone to build dynamic, scalable, and responsive web applications.

*Describe how you plan to accomplish Learning Objective #1.*

- **Multi-Tool Integration Projects:** Work on projects that require the use of advanced tools like Flask for backend development, Next.js for React-based server-side rendering, Tailwind and Ant Design for frontend styling, GraphQL for efficient API querying, and Keystone for content management.
- **Structured Experimentation:** Create mini-projects or isolated modules within larger projects to experiment with these tools in different combinations, understanding how they interact and complement each other.
- **Tool-Specific Learning Sessions:** Dedicate time to in-depth learning of each tool by exploring official documentation, tutorials, and examples. Attend webinars, workshops, or internal tech talks focused on these advanced tools.
- **Code Refactoring and Optimization:** Continuously refactor code using best practices to optimize performance and maintainability, focusing on how these advanced tools can streamline the development process.
- **Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams:** Work alongside designers, QA engineers, and other developers to gain insights into the practical use of these tools in production environments.

*Describe how, when and by whom Learning Objective #1 will be evaluated.*

- **Tool-Specific Deliverables:** Complete project tasks that showcase your application of each tool, with evaluations by team leads or project managers based on code quality, adherence to best practices, and effectiveness of the solutions implemented.
- **Bi-Weekly Technical Reviews:** Participate in technical reviews every two weeks where you present progress in using these tools, receiving feedback from mentors and senior developers.
- **Advanced Code Reviews:** Engage in more complex peer code reviews, focusing on the use of advanced web development frameworks, libraries, and tools.
- **Project-Based Evaluation:** Present a comprehensive web project or multiple feature implementations at the end of the co-op term that demonstrate your mastery of these advanced tools. The project will be evaluated based on functionality, design, scalability, and overall code quality.
- **Reflective Summary Report:** Write a report at the end of the term that reflects on your experience with these tools, detailing your learning process, key takeaways, and plans for future improvement. This report will be reviewed by your supervisor or mentor.

## **Learning Goal 2: Gain Competence in Cloud Platforms and Deployment**

### Learning Objective:
Learn to deploy, manage, and scale web applications on cloud-based platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

*Describe how you plan to accomplish Learning Objective #1.*

- **Project Work:** Deploy and manage web applications on cloud platforms as part of different project assignments.
- **Mentorship:** Receive guidance and feedback from experienced cloud engineers or mentors within the company.
- **Online Resources:** Utilize documentation and tutorials from cloud providers to learn best practices and advanced techniques.
- **Hands-On Experience:** Set up and configure cloud environments, manage resources, and implement CI/CD pipelines.

*Describe how, when and by whom Learning Objective #1 will be evaluated.*

- **Weekly Check-Ins:** Have weekly meetings with a mentor or supervisor to discuss progress, challenges, and learning outcomes.
- **Deployment Milestones:** Achieve specific cloud deployment milestones for each project, evaluated by the project manager or cloud team lead.
- **Final Deployment Review:** Present a fully deployed web application on a cloud platform at the end of the co-op term for evaluation.
- **Peer Review:** Participate in peer review sessions focused on cloud deployment strategies and best practices.
- **Self-Evaluation:** Maintain a journal documenting the deployment process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## **Learning Goal 3: Develop Proficiency in Containerization Using Docker and Kubernetes**

### Learning Objective: 
Gain a strong understanding of containerization principles and practices, focusing on using Docker and Kubernetes for building, deploying, and managing applications in containerized environments.

*Describe how you plan to accomplish Learning Objective #3.*

- **Dedicated Research Time:** Set aside time each week specifically for studying Docker and Kubernetes, focusing on topics like container creation, image management, container orchestration, and scaling.
- **Small-Scale Experiments:** Start by creating small, isolated projects where you practice containerizing simple applications using Docker and then orchestrate them with Kubernetes.
- **Shadowing Opportunities:** Observe experienced DevOps or cloud engineers as they use these tools in real-world scenarios, asking questions and taking notes to understand best practices.
- **Online Courses and Certifications:** Complete relevant online courses or certifications on containerization technologies to build a structured foundation.
- **Internal Workshops:** Organize or attend in-house workshops or study groups focused on Docker and Kubernetes, engaging in hands-on labs and collaborative learning sessions.

*Describe how, when and by whom Learning Objective #3 will be evaluated.*

- **Learning Logs:** Maintain a detailed log of research, small experiments, and concepts learned, which will be reviewed periodically by a mentor or supervisor.
- **Project Application:** Apply containerization to one or more assigned projects, deploying applications using Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters. The effectiveness and reliability of the deployment will be evaluated by a project lead.
- **Skill Demonstration:** Participate in a mid-term review session where you demonstrate setting up a Docker container and deploying it on Kubernetes to your mentor or peers.
- **Final Reflection Report:** Submit a report at the end of the co-op term detailing your journey, the challenges faced, how you overcame them, and the practical applications of containerization tools in your projects.
- **Peer Evaluation:** Engage in peer discussions where you present your containerization setup and receive feedback from colleagues who are also exploring these tools.
